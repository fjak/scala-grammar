start symbol TemplateBody

// The priorization from the Expr token is not respected in the TemplateBody
// context. Unfortunately, I currently do not have a clue how to disambiguate
// the following input. What the parser should do is always take as much from the
// expressions as possible, and thus not split this into three TemplateStatSemis.
test InfixExpr > PostfixExpr in template body [[

	foo &&
	bar
}
